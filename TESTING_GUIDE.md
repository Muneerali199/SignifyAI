# 🧪 Testing Guide - ISL Translator App

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Buffer Logic Fixed**
- **Problem**: The frame counter check was happening BEFORE the counter increment, so it never reached 30 frames
- **Solution**: Changed to a local `frameCount` variable that increments correctly and triggers prediction at exactly 30 frames

### 2. **Added Debug Logging**
Now you'll see detailed console logs showing:
- 📸 When prediction starts (after 30 frames)
- 🎯 Prediction results with gesture name and confidence
- ✅ Matched gestures from your gesture list
- ⚠️ If confidence is below threshold
- 🔊 When speech starts and completes
- ❌ Any errors that occur

### 3. **Speech Service Already Working**
- Speech service is properly initialized in AppContext
- Automatically speaks when gesture is detected
- Uses `expo-speech` with English-India language

## 📱 How to Test

### Step 1: Check Expo Server
Make sure Expo is running on port **8082** (not 8081):
```
Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.17:8082
```

### Step 2: Open App on Phone
1. Open **Expo Go** app
2. Scan the QR code from terminal
3. Wait for app to load

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
Look for these messages in terminal:
```
✓ Loaded 11 gesture labels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B
✓ Gesture recognition ready
```

### Step 4: Test Camera Tab
1. Tap **Camera** tab at bottom
2. Grant camera permission if asked
3. Tap the **blue camera button** to start recording
4. Watch the **green buffer bar** fill up at the bottom

### Step 5: What Should Happen
After **3 seconds** (when buffer reaches 100%):

**In Terminal Console:**
```
📸 Making prediction after 30 frames...
🎯 Prediction result: { gesture: '5', confidence: 0.94 }
✅ Matched gesture: { name: '5', description: 'ISL sign for number 5' }
🎉 Gesture detected in index.tsx: 5
   Confidence: 94.0%
🔊 Speaking: 5
✅ Speech complete
```

**On Phone Screen:**
- Buffer bar fills to 100% (green)
- Screen shows detected gesture (e.g., "5")
- Shows confidence score (e.g., "94%")
- **Phone speaks the gesture name** ("five")
- Gesture appears in **History** tab

### Step 6: Check History Tab
1. Tap **History** tab
2. You should see your detected gesture listed with:
   - Gesture name
   - Confidence score
   - Timestamp

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Buffer fills but nothing happens
**Check:**
1. Look at terminal console for error messages
2. Confidence might be below threshold (default 70%)
3. Go to **Settings** tab → Lower "Confidence Threshold" to 0.5 (50%)

### Issue: No speech output
**Check:**
1. Phone volume is turned up
2. Phone is not on silent mode
3. Look for "🔊 Speaking: X" in console
4. Settings tab → "Speech Enabled" is ON
5. Check if speechService is initialized (look for warnings in console)

### Issue: App crashes or doesn't load
**Check:**
1. Terminal for error messages
2. Try reloading: Press `r` in terminal or shake phone
3. Clear cache: Press `Shift+c` in terminal
4. Restart Expo: Press `Ctrl+C` then `npm start` again

### Issue: Camera permission denied
**Solution:**
1. Go to phone Settings → Apps → Expo Go
2. Enable Camera permission
3. Restart app

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Summary

| Time | Action | What You'll See | What You'll Hear |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| 0s | Tap camera button | Button turns red | - |
| 0-3s | Recording | Green bar filling up | - |
| 3s | Prediction | Bar resets, result appears | Phone says gesture name |
| 3s+ | Result shown | Card with gesture name & confidence | - |

## 📊 Current Settings

**Default Configuration:**
- **Confidence Threshold**: 70% (0.7)
- **Speech Enabled**: Yes
- **Speech Rate**: 1.0 (normal speed)
- **Language**: English (India)

**Prediction Details:**
- Simulated predictions (no real ML yet)
- Random gesture from: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B
- Confidence range: 85-99% (mimics your trained model)
- Every 3 seconds during recording

## 🔧 Adjusting Settings

Go to **Settings** tab to change:

1. **Confidence Threshold**: Lower if gestures aren't being detected
   - Try: 0.5 (50%) for testing
   - Production: 0.8 (80%) recommended

2. **Speech Rate**: Adjust speech speed
   - 0.5 = Slow
   - 1.0 = Normal (default)
   - 1.5 = Fast

3. **Speech Toggle**: Turn speech on/off

## 📝 Notes

- **Current Implementation**: Uses simulated predictions (random gestures)
- **Real Model**: Your trained TFLite model is ready in `app/assets/models/`
- **Next Step**: Integrate real TFLite inference when TensorFlow dependencies are resolved
- **Frame Rate**: 10 FPS (1 frame every 100ms)
- **Buffer Size**: 30 frames (3 seconds)

## ✨ Success Checklist

Test these scenarios:

- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Camera permission granted
- [ ] Can start/stop recording
- [ ] Buffer bar animates smoothly
- [ ] Prediction happens after 3 seconds
- [ ] Result card appears with gesture
- [ ] Confidence percentage shown
- [ ] Speech plays automatically
- [ ] Manual "Speak" button works
- [ ] Gesture appears in History tab
- [ ] Can adjust settings
- [ ] Multiple detections work in sequence

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Your app is now properly configured and should:
1. ✅ Detect gestures every 3 seconds while recording
2. ✅ Show results with confidence scores
3. ✅ Speak gesture names automatically
4. ✅ Save to history

**Restart Expo server if needed:**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
npm start
# Scan new QR code on phone
```

Good luck with testing! 🎉
