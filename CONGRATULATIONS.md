## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Better Builds:
```bash
# Clear cache if build fails
eas build --clear-cache

# Check build status
eas build:list

# View build logs
eas build:view [build-id]
```

### For Testing:
- Test in good lighting
- Hold gesture steady for 3 seconds
- Try all 11 gestures (1-9, A, B)
- Check history saves correctly
- Test settings adjustments

### For Production:
- Increment version number
- Update screenshots
- Write app description
- Create privacy policy
- Set up analytics (optional)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues:
```bash
# If eas command not found:
npm install -g eas-cli

# If login fails:
eas logout
eas login

# If build queue full:
# Wait 5-10 minutes and retry
```

### Install Issues:
- Enable "Unknown Sources" in Settings
- Uninstall old version first
- Check phone storage (need 200+ MB)
- Try different file manager

### App Issues:
- Grant camera permission
- Check Android version (need 5.0+)
- Clear app cache if crashes
- Reinstall if problems persist
